## Killer Mechanics
For [this](https://github.com/DanielleMonroeNY/GraphicDesigns/blob/main/KillerMechanics.jpeg) project, the client simply asked for a skull and crossbones style of a logo for an auto mechanic. The name, piston, and adjustable wrench were of my own volition. The piston and wrench are also posted to show their detail. 

## DJ RED
This client wished to update their already existing business card. I customized a design with the objective being to 1) simplify the imagry so the client's clients can clearly understand what he does and 2) Utilize psychology of color and incorporate is name and color appropriately throughout the design. Several designs were cultivated and the client finally decided on [this](https://github.com/DanielleMonroeNY/GraphicDesigns/blob/main/DJ%20REDFinal.jpeg) design. 

## Stay Kloudy Mylar Bag Design
These images were created for an already established company. The goal was to design a maylar bag that had the company's log and a "feminine-like" [image](https://github.com/DanielleMonroeNY/GraphicDesigns/blob/main/LadyFingersAndClouds.jpeg). Othes options for further development posted as well. 
** **PLEASE NOTE THAT THE MAIN 'STAY KLOUDY' LOGO IS NOT OF MY DESIGN OR MAKING** **

## WHY6 - Volunteer Work
I was asked by my local WHY6 chapter to put together a simple informational flyer. I decided to create a silhouette of solder to help represent who the organization served. They were quite pleased with the [results](https://github.com/DanielleMonroeNY/GraphicDesigns/blob/main/WHY6InfoFlyer%20-%20Silhouette.jpeg) and welcomed the intuitiveness.
