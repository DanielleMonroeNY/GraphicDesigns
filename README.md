## WHY6
I was asked by my local WHY6 chapter to put together a simple informational flyer. I decided to create a silhouette of solder to help represent who the organization served. They were quite pleased with the results and welcomed the intuitiveness. 

## Killer Mechanics
This project was done for my son. He simply asked for a skull and crossbones style of a logo. The name, piston, and adjustable wrench were of my own volition. 
The piston and wrench are also posted to show their detail. 

## Stay Kloudy Mylar Bag Design
These images were created for an already established company. The goal was to transform the companyâ€™s logo into "more feminine" images. Although I attempted to get better clarity of their wishes, ultimately I gave the company a few options to choose from. 
### PLEASE NOTE THAT THE MAIN 'STAY KLOUDY' LOGO IS NOT OF MY DESIGN OR MAKING
